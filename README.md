# Notes

Here is a collection of random notes/code samples that I will keep
here until I find a better place for them.

## TODO

1. Ant Allocator - simple memory allocator
2. DitaShark - clean up project
3. MCDS - clean up project
4. Start blog via GitHub pages
5. Move public writing into repo (off cloud)
6. Move personal writing into private repo

## Notes

* powerline - using in terminal you need to install patched
  fonts. Plus you need to select the font for the terminal to use.

* I noticed Microsoft are keeping all their .NET docs in GitHub now. I
  think that's a good idea and I need to write something up on that
  topic.

* Neocities.org - a real throw back. Wonderful idea and there's some
  real creativity there. 

* [Excellent talk on Rust and Concurrency by David
  Sullins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIikwmeGVYY). As a
  programmer it's really important to understand concepts of
  Resources, Ownership, Lifetime, Scope - and this is critical in a
  concurrent context. One minor point, scope is not necessarily the
  same thing as lifetime, at least in C (you can have a static
  varaible in a function with global lifetime but local scope).

* [Kavya Joshi on Keeping Time in Real
  Systems](https://youtu.be/BRvj8PykSc4). Great talk on clocks and
  clock synchronization in distributed systems.
